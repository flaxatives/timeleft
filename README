# timeleft
A script inspired by the `timeleft` command from Counterstrike 1.6 servers.

This is a simple script that scrapes a Google calendar to find time until your
next event. This will find the first N events that start or end after the
current time. So you can use this in class or a meeting by typing

    $ timeleft
    5:51:34 until DRNK 4175 Alcohol and Algorithms

Caching the calendar hasn't been implemented yet, so don't run this script
10,000 times and exhaust all your API calls.

## Instructions
Before you start, make sure you get a Google developer API key for Google
Calendar. Or else you won't be able to authenticate.

1. Install Google calendar Python library
2. Edit `settings.py` to your liking.
3. Make a symlink and put it into an executable path, e.g. `~/bin`

    $ ln -s timeleft.py ~/bin/timeleft
    $ timeleft
    5:51:34 until DRNK 4175 Alcohol and Algorithms

## TODO
[ ] Use the old CS 1.6 announcer that says the timeleft
[ ] Keep a cache of the calendar to reduce API fetches
